# Quick_sorting
This project is a very great example for Quick_sorting algorithm. If you have a little bit of programming knowledge, you can write this code in any programming language. also I explained how this code works.
# How does it work?
This algorithm is really fast and easy!
first of all we chose an element (r)(last one but no difference) then sort dvide other elements by 2 group: 1. less than r, 2. more than r;
with recursion we do this function over and over till we have an array(not an new array, just two indexes) which has 2 sorted element and then we have a sorted array.

# Time:
<u><p>Expected value: <i>T = θ(nlogn) </p>
  <p>
  </i>Worst run time: <i> T = θ(n^2)
  </p></i></u>

(n is number of elements and T is not necessarily seconds)

# How can we test it?

That's so simple! there is a tester file you can use!
